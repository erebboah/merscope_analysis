# Analysis of pilot MERFISH data

Brains and pituitary glands were collected separately from 6-week-old B6/AJ F1 mice and fresh-frozen in OCT. The data consists of 3 hypothalamus coronal sections from 3 individuals, 1 complete pituitary coronal section, and 2 incomplete pituitary coronal sections. Processed using v1.0 MERFISH chemistry (sample prep kit cat. #10400012, imaging kit cat. #10400005, slides cat. #10500001) and imaged on MERSCOPE Ultra instrument. Designed [300 gene panel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JkyxyGoJ88RZw2jjLuQRELEANUxl-QASRcivJyJLXVk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) based on canonical marker genes, cluster markers from analysis of corresponding snRNA-seq data of the same region, and genotype-specific markers from our [analysis of diverse mouse strains](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.21.649844v1).
